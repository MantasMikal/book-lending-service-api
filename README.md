## About

This repository contains the growing code-base of our example Koa-based RESTful API.

During the semester we will begin by creating the skeleton of a simple HTTP server with RESTful endpoints using the Koa framework. We will then fill this out with middleware and routes to create a fully functioning backend for a secure RESTful web application.

## Tags / Releases

Important commits will be tagged so that you can check out a tag and begin working from a known starting point (e.g. what is used in one of the demonstration videos).

Generally tags will refer to the week the code applies to and will have a description about its state such as _week 2 code after completion of basic worksheet tasks_.

To see tags in the terminal use `$ git tag -ln1`. In Github the tags appear under the 'release' subtab in the main repository 'code' tab.
